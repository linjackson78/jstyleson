# jstyleson

![](https://travis-ci.org/linjackson78/jstyleson.svg?branch=master)

jstyleson is a python library to parse JSON with js-style comments. Trailing comma is also supported.

JSON by standard does not allow comments and trailing comma, and the python standard json module does not offer options to parse such informal JSON.

```python
import json
invalid_json_str = """{
    // Single-line comment
    "foo": "bar", // Behold that trailing comma
    /*
    Multi-line comment
     */
}
"""
json.loads(invalid_json_str) # Raise Exception
```

jstyleson try to make it happy with your js-style commented JSON, by first removing all elements inside (comments and trailing comma), then hand it to the standard json module.

jstyleson supports parsing JSON with:

* single-line comment
* multi-line comment
* inline comment
* trailing comma

# Installation

`pip install jstyleson`

OR, using conda:

`conda install -c conda-forge jstyleson`

# Usage

jstyleson provide some wrapper function around the standard json module:

```python
import jstyleson
result_dict = jstyleson.loads(invalid_json_str) # OK
jstyleson.dumps(result_dict)
```

Under the hood, jstyleson do nothing but remove all invalid elements via the `dispose` function. So you can invoke it manually like this:

`valid_json_str = jstyleson.dispose(invalid_json_str)`

# Testing

`python setup.py test`
